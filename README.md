## Project title: Analysis of Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset

### Project Description

The purpose of this project is to investigate the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset by analysing the dataset and providing a literary review on classifiers applied to the dataset and campare their performance. 

Using Pandas,Seaborn,SKLearn and machine learning algorithms, train a set of classifiers on the dataset and present classification performance results, detailing rationale for the parameter selections made whist training the classifiers.

Compare, contrast and critique your results with reference to the literature. Discuss and investigate how the dataset could be extended â€“ using data synthesis of new tumour datapoints.
